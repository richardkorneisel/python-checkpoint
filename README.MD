# Python Checkpoint 1

## Before You Start

- **Fork and clone** this repo.

## Running Tests

To execute all the tests in the terminal, run `pytest`. Every time you make a change and
save your files, you will need to manually re-run the tests.

Each test file corresponds to one of the code files.

| test file | code file | 
| ----------| ----------|
| tests/data_types_test.py | data_types.py |
| tests/methods_test.py | methods.py |
| tests/oop_test.py | oop.py |

To run a single test file: `pytest ./tests/path-to-test-file.py`

When you start, all of the tests will be failing; your goal is to make as many
pass as you can in the hour provided.

> HINT: read the output of the failing tests.

## Instructions

This checkpoint is divided into three sections:

- Data Types in `data_types.py`
- Methods in `methods.py`
- Object Oriented Programming in `oop.py`

Each section has a series of prompts written in inline comments. Write the
Python necessary to complete each prompt in each of the three files.

**Make a commit after you complete each section.**

**DO NOT** Modify the files in the `tests/` folder.

## Submission

Fork this repository and clone your fork locally. Commit as you go. When you are
finished, push your commits to GitHub.

**Wait until the end of the hour to make your Pull Request.**
